## Getting Started

### CDN

This is [cdnjs](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs) reverse proxy service. we can support the rapid loading of the world.

You can replace `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/` to `https://cdn.dawoea.net/` like this:

before:
```
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css
```

after:
```
https://cdn.dawoea.net/twitter-bootstrap/4.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css

or

https://cdn.dawoea.net/bootstrap/4.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css
```

> For now only twitter-bootstrap can rewrite to bootstrap.
>
> If you want to support rewrite more libraries you can [new issues](https://github.com/dawoea/Telescopium/issues/new).
